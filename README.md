# What-We-Drinkin

## Description
A website to help customers find out what they want to drink and give them options for what they like.

- We noticed there must be a better way of selecting what kind of liquor people must want.

- We wanted to create a way to help people find diffrent kids of liquor that they havent tried.

- We solved the problem of helping people try diffrent kinds of liquor and showing what the price is and what kind of liquor it is.

- We learned a lot together because we couldnt figure out how to put a table together or catagorize these diffrent kinds of liquor.
